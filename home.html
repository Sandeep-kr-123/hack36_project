            <h2>INTRODUCTION ABOUT TECHNICAL EDUCATION:</h2>
            <p> world that we are experiencing today is because of the advancement of science and technology which is a
                result of technical education.
                Technical education is quite different from the academical education as academical education only
                teaches
                topics for the grading purpose but where as technical education gives you a complete knowledge and
                support
                for your future and also make you unique from the crowd.
                Here we are discussing most important technical skills these days.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>CONTENTS:</h2>
            <h3>1] ROCKET SCIENCE</h3>
            <br>
            <h4>INTRODUCTION:</h4>
            <p>As we all familiar with rockets, as these are used to keep satellites in the orbit around the earth or a
                planet or a star.
                Rocket science is one of the most leading topic in the world right now.
                This study involves and focuses mainly on making satellites and orbiting them in the space around a star
                or a planet.
                This plays vital role in developing modern technology as they study the earths atmosphere through
                satellites, and also these satellites are helpful in many fields like agriculture, natural disaster
                management, military, communication etc….
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>STUDYING REFERENCES:</h4>
            <p>The persons who are interested can pursue degree in aerospace and to specialize in degree in the design
                and manufacture of the spacecraft. <br>
                Also, one who are interested in learning this can also learn as a side skill which enhances the skills
                of a person and helps him to change this society and find his passion. <br>
                The main aim of the rocket science students is to design spacecraft that works in outer space, and also
                to building satellites body.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Career:</h4>
            <p>The rocket scientists are paid with descent highest salary package and also they can enjoy the job as
                they found the job for what they are passionate for.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Tips and tricks:</h3>

            <p>
                As “Elon musk” the most famous bilinear the CEO of the SpaceX, Tesla and the boring company once stated
                in an interview that their children itself are learning from YouTube.
            </p>
            <p>-> Explore the websites and browse for the topics </p>
            <p>-> Learn from online teaching platforms like YouTube, Udemy, Edx etc... </p>
            <p>-> Collaborate with technicians and learn more facts and stay tuned to latest discoveries and also try to
                learn from them.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>2] SPACE EXPLORATION</h3>
            <br>
            <h4>INTRODUCTION:</h4>
            <P>“The life without a space exploration vanishes” said by a great scientist space exploration is studying
                about the space in different aspects like estimating size of space, life time of stars and planets,
                evidence for existence of life in other planets and also to find how the life is started.
                <br>
                This study involves not only outer space study but also studying about earths atmosphere in deep.
            </P>
            <br>
            <h4>STUDYING REFERENCE:</h4>
            <P>As a person wants to work as a space scientist, he must study his degree in physics or aerospace. <br>
                If a person wants to know this as skill or gain knowledge in it there are plenty of theories published
                in the internet itself, so one can find some resources there and gain knowledge there.
            </P>
            <br>
            <h4>SKILLS REQUIRED:</h4>
            <P>-->One should be found of science and physics particularly. <br>
                -->One should be a bibliophile as he must learn more and more books to find the information.
            </P>
            <br>
            <h3>Career:</h3>
            <p>The space scientists can also earn more money and also they can earn more respect from the society as
                they are the heroes who are changing the world, and making earth as a better place to live. <br>
                It was one of the most amazing job in this society.
            </p>

            <h3>3] PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            <P>As everyone are well known with the programming languages the phones, laptops, smart tv’s all are the
                biproducts of this programming. <br>
                The programming languages are invented to compute hard problems first then later on they are keep on
                updating in a level that the life of human being and programming languages are intermixed. <br>
                There are may programming languages like c, c++, c#, java, JavaScript, sql, html, CSS, ruby, python many
                more
            </P>
            <br>
            <h3>Applications of programming language:</h3>
            <p>These programming languages are used in making- <br>
                -->Operating systems <br>
                -->Web development <br>
                -->Applications <br>
                -->Games <br>
                And many more applications are there
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Studying references:</h3>
            <p>As now a days craze of programming languages are at peak that we find many of the course readily
                available on the internet on various platforms. <br>
                There is no requirement of any degree, anyone can do learn programming languages and build their own
                projects.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Outcomes of programming languages:</h3>
            <p>-->Quantum computation (not alone programming language can do it) <br>
                -->Machine learning <br>
                -->Artificial intelligence <br>
                -->Social media <br>
            </p>
